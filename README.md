:book: &nbsp; In 2020, I completed my PhD thesis on the use of deep neural networks for image and video super-resolution problems using Generative Adversarial Networks. 

:office: &nbsp; I then worked at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, working on software development for applying DL on bioimage analysis tasks. I now work at Meero as a CV engineer, creating algorithms that automatically create beautiful images ðŸ“¸
